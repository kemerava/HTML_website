<h1> Here is why we like these animals</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        Rabbits are very cute and sweet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rabbits are very social creatures that live in groups.
        <ul>
            <li>The European rabbit lives underground, in burrows.</li>
            <li>A group of burrows is known as a warren.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Rabbits’ eyes are on the sides of their head, meaning they can see almost all the way around them.</li>
    <li>A rabbit’s teeth never stop growing!</li>
    <li>Like cats, happy rabbits purr when they’re content and relaxed.</li>
    <li>Rabbits are amazing athletes — they can jump as high as 90 centimetres in one leap!</li>
    <li>A rabbit’s best feature? Their long ears! Growing up to 10 centimetres in length, rabbits can turn their ears by
        180 degrees, keeping a careful listen out for predators.
