<p id="general">Many programmers are fascinated with music. Music definitely helps with coding. Let me tell you about
    the music course I am
    taking and the music that helps me code.<br/>
    As I am writing this page I am listening to music. <br/>

<blockquote cite="https://www.musicnotes.com/now/omg/50-inspirational-quotes-about-music/">
    Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything. <br/>
    Musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the
    inward places of the soul.<br/>
    I would teach children music, physics, and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all
    the arts are the keys to learning.
